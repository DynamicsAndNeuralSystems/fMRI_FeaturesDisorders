PD_PeriodicityWang_th0_01,Periodicities,First peak in ACF after detrending time series,"First peak in the autocorrelation function after detrending the time-series with a single-knot cubic regression spline, described in Wang et al. (2007)"
SP_Summaries_welch_rect_area_5_1,Periodicities,Total power in lowest frequency quintile,Total power in the lowest 20% of frequencies in the Fourier power spectrum; a high value indicates the time-series has most power in its lower frequencies and a low value indicates the time-series has most power in its higher frequencies
SP_Summaries_welch_rect_centroid,Periodicities,Centroid frequency in power spectrum,"The centroid frequency value in the Fourier power spectrum; a high value indicates the time-series has most of its power in high frequencies, while a low value indicates the time-series is slow-varying with most power in lower frequencies."
SC_FluctAnal_2_dfa_50_1_2_logi_prop_r1,Self-affine scaling,DFA slower timescale proportions,"Proportion of slower timescale fluctuations that scale with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) after downsampling the time series by a factor of 2; a low value means the time series scaling regime changes at shorter timescales, while a higher value means the time series scaling regime changes at longer timescales."
SC_FluctAnal_2_rsrangefit_50_1_logi_prop_r1,Self-affine scaling,Linear rescaling slower timescale proportions,"Proportion of slower timescale fluctuations that scale with linearly rescaled range fits; a low value means the time series scaling regime changes at shorter timescales, while a higher value means the time series scaling regime changes at longer timescales."

DN_OutlierInclude_n_001_mdrmd,Spacing of extreme events,Median time between sub-mean outliers,"Median time interval between successive extreme events below the mean; a value closer to -1 indicates that extreme negative values are clustered toward the beginning of the time series, while a value closer to 1 indicates that extreme negative values are clustered toward the end of the time series"
DN_OutlierInclude_p_001_mdrmd,Spacing of extreme events,Median time between above-mean outliers,"Median time interval between successive extreme events above the mean; a value closer to -1 indicates that extreme positive values are clustered toward the beginning of the time series, while a value closer to 1 indicates that extreme positive values are clustered toward the end of the time series"
