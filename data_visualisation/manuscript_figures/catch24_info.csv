SC_FluctAnal_2_rsrangefit_50_1_logi_prop_r1,Linear rescaling slower timescale proportions,Self-affine scaling,"Proportion of slower timescale fluctuations that scale with linearly rescaled range fits; a low value means the time series scaling regime changes at shorter timescales, while a higher value means the time series scaling regime changes at longer timescales."
SP_Summaries_welch_rect_area_5_1,Total power in lowest frequency quintile,Periodicities,Total power in the lowest 20% of frequencies in the Fourier power spectrum; a high value indicates the time-series has most power in its lower frequencies and a low value indicates the time-series has most power in its higher frequencies
SP_Summaries_welch_rect_centroid,Centroid frequency in power spectrum,Periodicities,"The centroid frequency value in the Fourier power spectrum; a high value indicates the time-series has most of its power in high frequencies, while a low value indicates the time-series is slow-varying with most power in lower frequencies."
