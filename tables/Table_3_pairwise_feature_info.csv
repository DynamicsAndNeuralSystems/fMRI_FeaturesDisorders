SPI,Description
PSI_frequency,"Phase slope index (PSI) of the frequency domain, measures information flow based on complex-valued coherency"
ANM,"Additive noise model, tests for directed nonlinear dependence of x --> y"
DI,"Directed information, measures information flow from one time series to another without any time-lags"
transfer_entropy,"Transfer entropy, measures information flow from one time series to another with Takens time-delay embedding"
phi_star,"Phi-star, integrated information proxy that measures information lost when two time series are disconnected"
spectral_GC,"Spectral Granger causality, frequency domain equivalent to Granger causality (nonparametric)"
PLI,"Phase lag index, measures phase synchronization across the full frequency range"
PSI_time_frequency,"PSI of the time-frequency domain, measures information flow based on complex-valued coherency"
barycenter_DTW,"Barycenter, the univariate time series that captures the center of mass between two time series"
DTW,"Dynamic time warping, measures the minimum distance between two (potentially dilated) time series"
power_envelope_corr,"Power envelope correlation, measures correlation between power envelopes of two time series"
coherence_magnitude,"Coherence magnitude, measures mean coherence between two time series for full frequency range"
cointegration,"Cointegration, tests if the linear combination of two time-series has a lower integration order"
Pearson,"Pearson correlation coefficient -- computed as empirical covariance, which is equivalent as we z-score data"
