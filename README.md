# _catch22_ for cfg.mat files

There are three main files, which will:
* Firstly, read in a `cfg.mat` file and output an `elementnDATASET.txt` file, which is the format that the time series data will be stored in
* Secondly,
* And finally,

The main functions in the analysis (along with the respective lines of code) are as follows:

#### Generating the Time Series Data text file

### Processing data
Given access to XXX.
Run:
```python

```
Yields:
* Scatter plot of X versus Y
* Computation of p-value

### Compute classification rates

First, define the path and label the dataset:
