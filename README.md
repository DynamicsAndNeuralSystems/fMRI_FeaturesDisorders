# fMRI feature-based classification

## Feature extraction and data processing

```python
classifyFeatMat('hello',1)
```

* Data files are read in (in what format, how, ...)
* How the computation is done
* What processing is performed (if any)
* What files are written out

Writes time series by feature matrices in some format (?) to file.


## Analyses

### Plot data matrix for an individual

```python
getBalancedAcc_and_fdArray.py
```

### Compute classification accuracy at the region-by-region level


### Compute classification accuracy at the individual feature level
