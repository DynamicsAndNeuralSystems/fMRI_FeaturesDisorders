# Feature extraction and classification for schizophrenia neuroimaging

This repository provides R code that facilitates time-series feature extraction from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data using [_catch22_](https://github.com/chlubba/catch22) from a Matlab .mat file. These 22 features are then used as inputs to univariate and multivariate classifiers to delineate schizophrenia patients from cognitively normal controls. 

The repo is organized into five components:

1. Data preparation

2. Quality control

3. ROI-based classification analysis

4. Feature-based classification analysis

5. Combined ROI- and feature-based classification analysis
